# Code Refactor Starter Code
This project required that I refactor code in the CSS and HTML files given.
I added alt="Captions" to the images in the HTML so that a web reader could recite titles for the images.
I reworked the class=hero so that the image source was pulled in the HTML instead of CSS. This allowed an alt caption to be added to it.
I gave the page a title.
I made sure the heading attributes fell into sequence by reworking h2 into h4 in the copywrite section at the bottom of the page.
